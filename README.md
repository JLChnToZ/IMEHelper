IME Helper Library
=========

This is a library for using IME (Input Method Editor) in XNA Framework.

If you want the users are able to typing Chinese, Japanese, Korean, etc. in your XNA game/application with IME, this library might be what you want.

This library just wrapped the messages sent from the IME, and it does not contains any text editing component, thus you have to implement them yourselves.

I have also included a sample game project called IMEHelperTest to test out and deomstrate how the library works. (Sorry for the undocumented code, but hope you can understand it.)

Please feel free to use this library as it is licensed with LGPLv3.
