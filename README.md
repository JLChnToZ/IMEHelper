IME Helper Library
=========

This is a library for using IME (Input Method Editor) in XNA Framework.

I have also included a sample game project called IMEHelperTest to test out and deomstrate how the library works. (Sorry for the undocumented code, but hope you can understand it.)

Please feel free to use this library as it is licensed with LGPLv3.
